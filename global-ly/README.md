Welcome to my dev_challenge website! I had trouble deploying the website and making it accessible by link. I followed the instructions on the dev application but the link still does not work. Please esxcuse the poor look of the repository, I am a GitHub novice and did not have a sense on how my repository should be organized or look.

With this website you should be able to generate new up and coming artists at the click of a button. Simply press the button, and you will see a new artist along with their hometowne, bio, photo, and three recent tweets by them. Enjoy!
